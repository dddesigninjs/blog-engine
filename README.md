# NodeJS blog engine

This repository is an example of how to build blog engine using Domain-Driven Design patterns

## Bounded-Contexts:
Bounded-contexts are inside `lib` directory, each bounded-context is a self contained library that has its own dependencies and written  using the architectural pattern that helps to solve the problem domain:
- `blog`: WIP
- `identity-access`: TODO
- `commenting`: TODO
